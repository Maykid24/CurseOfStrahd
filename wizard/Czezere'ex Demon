Czezere'ex Demon


---**--- Eye of Czezere'ex ---**---

- Wonderous item, Artifact (No Attunement required)
- Czezere'ex is a fragmented fiend who seeks to be reunited and made whole and will go to many lengths to achieve that.
  While fragmented he is tormented pushing his agenda on any recipients of his power, to find the rest of him;
  good or evil does not matter, it's all a means to an end: to be whole.

Sentience:
    - Czezere'ex is sentient lawful evil with an Intelligence of 11, Wisdom 12, and Charisma 14. It has hearing and
      Darkvision out to a range of 120ft. Czezere'ex communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read,
      and understand Infernal, Barovian, and common

Attunement (The eye is not required):
    - To attune to the eye and further parts, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact into the empty socket.
    They eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden
    eye with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die.

Chainers Bond:
    - During a long rest you may look at several creatures giving them a fiendish boon of knowledge and connection.
    During a long rest you may target several creatures equal to your intelligence modifier, and give them all one of
    three choices that lasts until the next long rest:
        1. They become proficient in one skill you choose that you are proficient in.
        2. They can read, write, speak, and understand the languages you know.
        3. You and each targeted creature gain telepathy with each other out to a maximum range of one mile, centered
        on yourself. Creatures outside of the range of one mile from you lose this connection until back in range.
