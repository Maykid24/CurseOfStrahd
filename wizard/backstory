-- BACKSTORY --

Name: Skidik
Age: 30
Sex: Male
Race: Shadar-Kai

I was a naive young Shadar-Kai. I was a little more rebellious than others around my village and was punished more than
others for various different reasons. One of the main reasons I was getting punished was due to me playing with a dull
sword and as I would hit the tree stump, tiny green flames spat out of the sword and would start fires in the nearby
forest. At the time, I didn't know how to control this or why it was occurring, I thought it had to do something with the
Raven Queen. As an individual that serves the Raven Queen, I thought being rebellious would be
more acceptable among the elders of the village... I guess the elders had a different idea of what a Shadar-Kai should be.

The elders thought it would be wise to learn the art of magic and sent me to the University and hopefully grow out of
my rebellious ways... However, within two years of attending the University I was expelled for not being able to follow
the rules trying to experiment with things I shouldn't be experimenting with as a second year. Don't get me wrong, within
those two years I was able to start controlling the green flame that would spit out of swords I would wield and learned
very basic spells during my time at the University... However, when I was trying to learn more experienced spells, I was
caught in the forbidden section of the University and was immediately thrown out.

Now I'm trying to find my way in the world as I can't go back to the University until I find a way to get accepted again
and I'm unable to go back to my village until I have something to prove to the elders that I've changed from my
rebellious ways into something the village would need.
