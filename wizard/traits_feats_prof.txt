--**-- Traits --**--
Darkvision
    - Up to 60 feet

Keen Senses
    - You have proficiency in Perception skill

Fey Ancestory
    - You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.

Trance
    - Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day.
      (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams
      are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way,
      you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.
        - Whenever you finish this trance, you can gain two proficiencies that you don’t have, each one with a weapon
          or a tool of your choice selected from the Player’s Handbook. You mystically acquire these proficiencies by
          drawing them from shared elven memory, and you retain them until you finish your next long rest.

Blessing of the Raven Queen
    - As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.
      You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended
      uses when you finish a long rest.
        - Starting at 3rd level, you also gain resistance to all damage when you teleport using this trait.
          The resistance lasts until the start of your next turn. During that time, you appear ghostly and translucent.

Necrotic Resistance
    - You have resistance to necrotic damage
