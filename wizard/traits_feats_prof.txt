--**-- Traits --**--
Darkvision
    - Up to 60 feet

Keen Senses
    - You have proficiency in Perception skill

Fey Ancestory
    - You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.

Trance
    - Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day.
      (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams
      are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way,
      you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.
        - Whenever you finish this trance, you can gain two proficiencies that you don’t have, each one with a weapon
          or a tool of your choice selected from the Player’s Handbook. You mystically acquire these proficiencies by
          drawing them from shared elven memory, and you retain them until you finish your next long rest.

Blessing of the Raven Queen
    - As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.
      You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended
      uses when you finish a long rest.
        - Starting at 3rd level, you also gain resistance to all damage when you teleport using this trait.
          The resistance lasts until the start of your next turn. During that time, you appear ghostly and translucent.

Necrotic Resistance
    - You have resistance to necrotic damage

Training in War and Song
    - When you adopt this tradition at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with light armor,
      and you gain proficiency with one type of one-handed melee weapon of your choice.

    - You also gain proficiency in the Performance skill if you don’t already have it.

Bladesong
    - Starting at 2nd level, you can invoke an elven magic called the Bladesong,
      provided that you aren’t wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield.
      It graces you with supernatural speed, agility, and focus.

    - You can use a bonus action to start the Bladesong, which lasts for 1 minute.
      It ends early if you are incapacitated, if you don medium or heavy armor or a shield,
      or if you use two hands to make an attack with a weapon.
      You can also dismiss the Bladesong at any time (no action required).

    - While your Bladesong is active, you gain the following benefits:
        - You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1)
        - Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.
        - You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.
        - You gain a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make to maintain your concentration on a spell.
          The bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).
        - You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus,
          and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
