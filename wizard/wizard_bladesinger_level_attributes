-- Bladesong --
Starting at 2nd level, you can invoke an elven magic called the Bladesong, provided that you aren’t wearing medium
or heavy armor or using a shield. It graces you with supernatural speed, agility, and focus.

You can use a bonus action to start the Bladesong, which lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated,
if you don medium or heavy armor or a shield, or if you use two hands to make an attack with a weapon. You can also
dismiss the Bladesong at any time (no action required).

While your Bladesong is active, you gain the following benefits:
    - You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1)
    - Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.
    - You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.
    - You gain a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make to maintain your concentration on a spell.
      The bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it
when you finish a long rest.

-- Extra Attack --

Moreover, you can cast one of your cantrips in place of one of those attacks.

Beginning at 10th level, you can direct your magic to absorb damage while your Bladesong is active. When you take

times the spell slot's level.
